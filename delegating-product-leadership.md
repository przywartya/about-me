If you're a founder, chances are you're not just [the guardian of code](https://github.com/przywartya/about-me/edit/main/autonomous-team.md). You're also the product person. You're reviewing PRs not only for correctness but for whether this is even the right solution for the user. You're making business, product and technical decisions at the same time.

That's a much harder thing to delegate. You can teach a senior engineer to review code well. Teaching someone to make good product calls requires them to have the full context of the business, the users, the strategy. The question becomes: can you grow a project lead who is not just the technical lead but the product lead for that scope? Can you delegate product thinking the same way you delegate code reviews?

I'm still working through this one. More on that soon.
